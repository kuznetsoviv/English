Пример письма:

Hello Tom,
How are you? I'm writting to tell you some news about my family.

Do you remember my elder sister Olga? She has recently married! 
Her husband is a Swiss national. Next week they will go to Swizerland 
and i will move to my sister's room. Now it is mine!
I am very glad that I'll have my own room, finally.

My mother is very happy, but she is little sad too. Switzerland is so far
from our home, so we won't able to vizit our sister often.
But we hope that she will often call us and write letters.

Oh, and another thing! My brother Alex will finish school next your. 
And my sister's husband says that Alex can live with them, if he wants to study in Switzerland.
Alex is very surprised by this offer and dreams about life in Switzerland for days on end.

Well, got to go now. Drop me a line when you are free.

Your friend,
Sergey.
